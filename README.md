# Image registration

This is a repository of everything I have learnt throughout the summer break 2024.

- Developed basic functions for image transformation
- Developed my own functions for RANSAC and Perspective transform
- Currently trying to write my own implementation of SIFT

## Learning goals
Below are the learning goals that were achieved.

- Target-to-source and source-to-target mapping
- Bi-linear interpolation
- Transformation of images (affine)
- Computation of homography
- Use of RANSAC(Random sample consensus)
- Use of SIFT algorithm.
